# Genetic Algorithm Implementation
Basic Genetic Algorithm implementation: Random Text Evolving into meaningful sentence.

Population limit = 2000
Generations limit = 40

Crossover = 2 point corssovers
Killing weakest 50% of the population in each generation

Performing mutation at 20% probability

The code also outputs the graphical analysis of the algorithm:
